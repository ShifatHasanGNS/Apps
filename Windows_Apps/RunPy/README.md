### What it does???
    
--> The question is very simple...

	* RunPy is a program which uses pyinstaller to create executable of a Python Program...

	* After creating executable, it instantly removes unnecessary files and copies the main executable file to the source python file's directory...

	* After finishing all of these tasks, 'RunPy' runs the executable file...

### Purpose : It will save your time...The executable file will run as fast as a C/C++ program...
